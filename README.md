# Employee Management System

## Overview
This is a simple yet comprehensive **Employee Management System** implemented using **Core Java** for backend logic and a **minimal HTML/CSS frontend** for a clean user interface. The project demonstrates key Java concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Collections (ArrayList), exception handling, and modular coding**.  

The frontend provides a neat dashboard to view employee records in a table format, along with options to add, edit, update, and delete employees.

## Technologies Used

- **Core Java** (Backend)
- **HTML & CSS** (Frontend)
- **Collections** (ArrayList)
- **Exception Handling** in Java
- **Git & GitHub** (Version control)


## How to Run

1. **Backend (Core Java)**  
   - Compile the Java files inside `src` folder:
     
     javac  EmployeeManagementSystem.java
   
   - Run the application:
     
     java EmployeeManagementSystem
   
   - Use the console menu to add, update, delete, or view employees.

2. **Frontend (HTML/CSS)**  
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in any modern web browser.  
   - Static frontend can be used for demo purposes alongside backend.
